Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an essential part of modern technology, enabling machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. One of the most popular applications of AI is a chatbot. This project focuses on the development of an AI Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to interact with users in a conversational manner, understand their input, and provide relevant responses.

Natural Language Processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. It allows machines to read, understand, and respond to text or speech in a meaningful way. In this project, NLP is used to analyze user input, identify keywords or patterns, and generate appropriate responses. The chatbot is implemented using the Python programming language along with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, which provides powerful tools for text processing and language understanding.

The chatbot works by following a rule-based approach. Predefined patterns and responses are created using regular expressions. When a user enters a message, the chatbot compares the input with the stored patterns and selects the most suitable response. This approach helps the chatbot handle common queries such as greetings, basic questions about artificial intelligence, and conversation termination commands like “bye” or “exit.” The NLTK reflections feature is also used to make the conversation more natural by converting user statements into appropriate responses.
